## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository<br/>
2. Install python3 (if you haven't already)<br/>
3. Install pip3 (if you haven't already)<br/>
4. Navigate to the root directory of the project<br/>
## How to Make Updates to the Project<br/>
***Note: NEVER commit straight to master***<br/>
1. Create a feature branch off of Master (read about git pull requests if you haven't already)<br/>
2. Make your changes on the branch<br/>
3. If you added any packages, add them to the requirements.txt file, by using the following command: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt<br/>
4. Add any new info to the README (if necessary)<br/>
5. Once done, commit all the changes and make a Pull Request with the following info:<br/>
  a. What the problem you attempted to solve<br/>
  b. How you did it<br/>
  c. Steps to test<br/>
6. Fix any merge conflicts (if any) and send a notification to the team<br/>
7. Now you can safely merge you branch <br/>
